# WXT + React

This template should help get you started developing with React in WXT.

```sh
bun create webdevsk/wxt-react-starter
```

You can also use your own project name by appending it to the script

```sh
bun create webdevsk/wxt-react-starter my-browser-extension
```

Or if you have already created the directory

```sh
mkdir my-browser-extension
cd my-browser-extension
bun create webdevsk/wxt-react-starter .
```
